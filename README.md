# ðŸš¨ FraudGuard: Detecting Credit Card Fraud using Machine Learning

FraudGuard is a machine learning project designed to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using real-world anonymized data. It employs supervised learning techniques to distinguish between genuine and fraudulent activity with high precision, even in highly imbalanced data.

About the dataset
ðŸ“„ Dataset Description
ðŸ“¦ File: creditcard.csv

ðŸ‘¥ Rows: 284,807 transactions

ðŸ“Š Columns: 31

Column Name	Description
Time	Time in seconds since the first transaction (used for time-series analysis, optional).
V1 to V28	Result of a PCA transformation on original features (e.g., amount, location, device info). Real column names are hidden for privacy.
Amount	The transaction amount in USD.
Class	Target variable: 0 = legitimate, 1 = fraudulent.

ðŸ§  Why "V1" to "V28"?
These are anonymized features â€” due to confidentiality and privacy concerns, the original feature names were removed.

The values are principal components created via PCA (Principal Component Analysis).

Theyâ€™re combinations of the original features that capture most of the variance in the dataset while removing sensitive information.

ðŸ§ª Summary of Columns:
Type	Columns
Identifier	Time
Features	V1 to V28
Additional	Amount
Target variable	Class (0 = non-fraud, 1 = fraud)

ðŸ§¯ Class Imbalance:
Legitimate (Class = 0): ~99.8%

Fraudulent (Class = 1): ~0.2%

This extreme imbalance is what makes it a challenging real-world problem.
